# Hi! I'm Molly 

I am an undergraduate at Harvard University studying Human Evolutionary Biology and I love data science and visualization! This past year I have been working with the Computational Epidemiology Lab at Boston Children's Hospital, and here are some of the data visualizations I have created working with them and independently!
